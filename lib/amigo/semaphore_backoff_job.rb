# Semaphore backoff jobs can reschedule themselves to happen at a later time
# if there is too high a contention on a semaphore.
# Ie, if there are too many jobs with the same key,
# they start to reschedule themselves for the future.
#
# This is useful when a certain job (or job for a certain target)
# can be slow so should not consume all available resources.
#
# In general, you should not use semaphore backoff jobs for singletons,
# as the guarantees are not strong enough.
# It is useful for many rapid jobs.
#
# Implementers must override the following methods:
#
# - `semaphore_key` must return the Redis key to use as the semaphore.
#   This may be something like "sbj-user-1" to limit jobs for user 1.
# - `semaphore_size` is the number of concurrent jobs.
#   Returning 5 would mean at most 5 jobs could be running at a time.
#
# And may override the following methods:
#
# - `semaphore_backoff` is called to know when to schedule the backoff retry.
#   By default, it is 10 seconds, plus between 0 and 10 seconds more,
#   so the job will be retried in between 10 and 20 seconds.
#   Return whatever you want for the backoff.
# - `semaphore_expiry` should return the TTL of the semaphore key.
#   Defaults to 30 seconds. See below for key expiry and negative semaphore value details.
# - `before_perform` is called before calling the `perform` method.
#   This is required so that implementers can set job state, based on job arguments,
#   that can be used for calculating the semaphore key.
#
# Note that we give the semaphore key an expiry. This is to avoid situation where
# jobs are killed, the decrement is not done, and the counter increases to the point we
# have fewer than the expected number of jobs running.
#
# This does mean that, when a job runs longer than the semaphore expiry,
# another job can be started, which would increment the counter back to 1.
# When the original job ends, the counter would be 0; then when the new job ends,
# the counter would be -1. To avoid negative counters (which create the same issue
# around missing decrements), if we ever detect a negative 'jobs running',
# we warn and remove the key entirely.
#
# == High Memory Utilization
#
# Queue backoff behavior is automatically disabled under high memory utilization,
# as per +Amigo::MemoryPressure+.
